Show all of the patients grouped into weight groups.
Show the total amount of patients in each weight group.
Order the list by the weight group decending.

For example, if they weight 100 to 109 they are placed in the 100 weight group, 110-119 = 110 weight group, etc.

Show patient_id, weight, height, isObese from the patients table.

Display isObese as a boolean 0 or 1.

Obese is defined as weight(kg)/(height(m)2) >= 30.

weight is in units kg.

height is in units cm.

All patients who have gone through admissions, can see their medical documents on our site. Those patients 
are given a temporary password after their first admission. Show the patient_id and temp_password.

The password must be the following, in order:
1. patient_id
2. the numerical length of patient's last_name
3. year of patient's birth_date

Each admission costs $50 for patients without insurance, and $10 for patients with insurance. 
All patients with an even patient_id have insurance.

Give each patient a 'Yes' if they have insurance, and a 'No' if they don't have insurance. 
Add up the admission_total cost for each has_insurance group.
